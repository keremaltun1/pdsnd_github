In this project, I analyzed the data of the bicycle sharing system of 3 major cities of the United States(Washington, Chicago, New York) using python language. In addition, i presented the options about city,month,day etc.to users that they would like see. Finally, before the script ended, I showed users the option to serve more raw data.
